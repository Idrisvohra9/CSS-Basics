    <h1 class="n1">In HTML classes are useful for big projects when the same elements require different styling. Classes are identified in the style tag inside the head element as the "."(dot) comes before them.</h1>
    <h1 class="bg color">If the name of a class contains spaces than it is considered as another class for the same element, That said the name after the space could act as a main class of that element i.e. it can override the styling of the previous class name. It can be used for dividing the style characteristics of the element.</h1>
    <span id="inline">The id attribute works the same way as the class attribute When it comes to CSS, but it is identified in the style tag inside the head element as the "#" (hash) symbol comes before it.</span>
    <h2><font color="red">Tip: </font>The class and id attributes both are case sensitive.</h2>
    <h1>Difference Between Class and ID</h1>
    <h3>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.</h3>
