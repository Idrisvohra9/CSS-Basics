* Margin is a css property that is used to control the spacing between elements.

* for example:
div{
    margin:10px;
}
imp: Here it means that the div element will have the same space at all places that is top, bottom, left, right.
* and Other elements will be seen accordingly.

* Padding is a css property that is used to control the spacing between the elements inside an element.

div{
    padding:10px;
}
// this will make space around the elements in the div element the space will be same at all places that is top, bottom, left, right.

# Margin vs Padding:

-> Margin makes space by pushing the adjacent elements away from it.
-> Padding makes space by growing the inner size of the element or reducing the size of the content inside it. 
by default it will increase the size.
(By setting box-sizing:border-box on the element the size of the content will shrink to accommodate the space.)

? When to use Padding?
* When we want to increase the size of an element,
* When we want to not touch the content to the border of the container,
* When we want to see more of the background of the container through the space of padding.


? When to use Margin?
* When we want that the element should not touch the adjacent element we use margin.
* if we give margin:auto; it will center the element on the screen horizontally(Vertically too if we use flexbox or grid)

// Margin and padding can be adjusted for a specific side of an element by using their own properties such as:
margin-top || padding-top
margin-right || padding-right
margin-bottom || padding-bottom
margin-left || padding-left

// And each of them have a shorthand use for writing css in one line that works like:
padding: top right bottom left; in px!!!(It goes clock wise)
margin: top right bottom left; in px!!!(It goes clock wise)

// Closing note: Margin is used to make space between adjacent elements, Padding is used to make space between elements in a element or inside of an element.
